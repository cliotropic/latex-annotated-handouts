# Administrivia

* Volunteer notetaker needed; see me after class.\sidenote{This will require you to visit the DRC (GC 190), copy your notes there at no cost, and leave them there for the student to retrieve. Or, DRC can provide special carbonless (NCR) paper that provides immediate copies of your notes. Thanks for your willingness to help.}
* The classroom cap for this room is 46 students. This is a limit imposed by the fire code. If you are not planning to stay in this course, please drop soon to make room for others.

# An exercise in curiosity

## What do you know about the US South after the Civil War (between 1865 and 1880)?
\vspace{36pt}

## What's one question you have about this time and place?
\vspace{36pt}

## If you could find an answer to that question, how do you think your life would change?
\vspace{36pt}


# Working in the "New South": from bondage to contract?

\marginnote{Ideology: a set of conscious and unconscious ideas that shapes people's actions and expectations. Ideologies are self-reinforcing; they often don't have much logic, but people behave as if they do.}

## Racial and gender ideologies (interrelated)

## What were some examples of racial and gender ideologies in the South after the end of slavery?
\vspace{36pt}

## Labor contracts after the end of slavery

\begin{fullwidth}
The right to work for oneself or sell one's labor; but at what price and under what conditions? Who defines "laziness"?
\end{fullwidth}


## Defining "vagrancy" after the end of slavery

"Enjoying" freedom; travel to reunite families; conflict with white-dominated racial ideologies about labor; post-1877 "black codes" defining "vagrancy" as a crime

# The Reconstruction Amendments

##13th Amendment (1865): 

\begin{fullwidth}
"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction."
\end{fullwidth}
	
##What did the 13th Amendment accomplish? What were its limitations?
\vspace{30pt}


## 14th Amendment (ratified 1868), Section 1:
\begin{fullwidth}
"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."
\end{fullwidth}

## What did the 14th Amendment accomplish? In the late 19th century, what were its limitations?

## 15th Amendment (ratified 1870): 

\begin{fullwidth}
"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude."

End of Union military occupation (Reconstruction), 1877. Republicans (African-Americans, some poor whites), Democrats (majority of whites). Creative ways to stop black voting: poll taxes, literacy tests.

%\begin{abstract}
%\noindent This document describes the Tufte handout \LaTeX\ document style.
%It also provides examples and comments on the style's use.  Only a brief
%overview is presented here; for a complete reference, see the sample book.
%\end{abstract}
%
%%\printclassoptions
%
%The Tufte-\LaTeX\ document classes define a style similar to the
%style Edward Tufte uses in his books and handouts.  Tufte's style is known
%for its extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with
%text, and well-set typography.  This document aims to be at once a
%demonstration of the features of the Tufte-\LaTeX\ document classes
%and a style guide to their use.
%
%\section{Page Layout}\label{sec:page-layout}
%\subsection{Headings}\label{sec:headings}
%This style provides \textsc{a}- and \textsc{b}-heads (that is,
%\Verb|\section| and \Verb|\subsection|), demonstrated above.
%
%The Tufte-\LaTeX\ classes will emit an error if you try to use
%\linebreak\Verb|\subsubsection| and smaller headings.
%
%% let's start a new thought -- a new section
%\newthought{In his later books},\cite{Tufte2006} Tufte
%starts each section with a bit of vertical space, a non-indented paragraph,
%and sets the first few words of the sentence in \textsc{small caps}.  To
%accomplish this using this style, use the \Verb|\newthought| command:  
%\begin{docspec}
%  \doccmd{newthought\{In his later books\}, Tufte starts\ldots}
%\end{docspec}
%
%\subsection{Sidenotes}\label{sec:sidenotes}
%One of the most prominent and distinctive features of this style is the
%extensive use of sidenotes.  There is a wide margin to provide ample room
%for sidenotes and small figures.  Any \Verb|\footnote|s will automatically
%be converted to sidenotes.\footnote{This is a sidenote that was entered
%using the \texttt{\textbackslash footnote} command.}  If you'd like to place ancillary
%information in the margin without the sidenote mark (the superscript
%number), you can use the \Verb|\marginnote| command.\marginnote{This is a
%margin note.  Notice that there isn't a number preceding the note, and
%there is no number in the main text where this note was written.}
%
%The specification of the \Verb|\sidenote| command is:
%\begin{docspec}
%  \doccmd{sidenote[\docopt{number}][\docopt{offset}]\{\docarg{Sidenote text.}\}}
%\end{docspec}
%
%Both the \docopt{number} and \docopt{offset} arguments are optional.  If you
%provide a \docopt{number} argument, then that number will be used as the
%sidenote number.  It will change of the number of the current sidenote only and
%will not affect the numbering sequence of subsequent sidenotes.
%
%Sometimes a sidenote may run over the top of other text or graphics in the
%margin space.  If this happens, you can adjust the vertical position of the
%sidenote by providing a dimension in the \docopt{offset} argument.  Some
%examples of valid dimensions are:
%\begin{docspec}
%  \ttfamily 1.0in \qquad 2.54cm \qquad 254mm \qquad 6\Verb|\baselineskip|
%\end{docspec}
%If the dimension is positive it will push the sidenote down the page; if the
%dimension is negative, it will move the sidenote up the page.
%
%While both the \docopt{number} and \docopt{offset} arguments are optional, they
%must be provided in order.  To adjust the vertical position of the sidenote
%while leaving the sidenote number alone, use the following syntax:
%\begin{docspec}
%  \doccmd{sidenote[][\docopt{offset}]\{\docarg{Sidenote text.}\}}
%\end{docspec}
%The empty brackets tell the \Verb|\sidenote| command to use the default
%sidenote number.
%
%If you \emph{only} want to change the sidenote number, however, you may
%completely omit the \docopt{offset} argument:
%\begin{docspec}
%  \doccmd{sidenote[\docopt{number}]\{\docarg{Sidenote text.}\}}
%\end{docspec}
%
%The \Verb|\marginnote| command has a similar \docarg{offset} argument:
%\begin{docspec}
%  \doccmd{marginnote[\docopt{offset}]\{\docarg{Margin note text.}\}}
%\end{docspec}
%
%\subsection{References}
%References are placed alongside their citations as sidenotes,
%as well.  This can be accomplished using the normal \Verb|\cite|
%command.\sidenote{The first paragraph of this document includes a citation.}
%
%The complete list of references may also be printed automatically by using
%the \Verb|\bibliography| command.  (See the end of this document for an
%example.)  If you do not want to print a bibliography at the end of your
%document, use the \Verb|\nobibliography| command in its place.  
%
%To enter multiple citations at one location,\cite{Tufte2006,Tufte1990} you can
%provide a list of keys separated by commas and the same optional vertical
%offset argument: \Verb|\cite{Tufte2006,Tufte1990}|.  
%\begin{docspec}
%  \doccmd{cite[\docopt{offset}]\{\docarg{bibkey1,bibkey2,\ldots}\}}
%\end{docspec}
%
%\section{Figures and Tables}\label{sec:figures-and-tables}
%Images and graphics play an integral role in Tufte's work.
%In addition to the standard \docenv{figure} and \docenv{tabular} environments,
%this style provides special figure and table environments for full-width
%floats.
%
%Full page--width figures and tables may be placed in \docenv{figure*} or
%\docenv{table*} environments.  To place figures or tables in the margin,
%use the \docenv{marginfigure} or \docenv{margintable} environments as follows
%(see figure~\ref{fig:marginfig}):
%
%\begin{marginfigure}%
%  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{helix}
%  \caption{This is a margin figure.  The helix is defined by 
%    $x = \cos(2\pi z)$, $y = \sin(2\pi z)$, and $z = [0, 2.7]$.  The figure was
%    drawn using Asymptote (\url{http://asymptote.sf.net/}).}
%  \label{fig:marginfig}
%\end{marginfigure}
%\begin{Verbatim}
%\begin{marginfigure}
%  \includegraphics{helix}
%  \caption{This is a margin figure.}
%\end{marginfigure}
%\end{Verbatim}
%
%The \docenv{marginfigure} and \docenv{margintable} environments accept an optional parameter \docopt{offset} that adjusts the vertical position of the figure or table.  See the ``\nameref{sec:sidenotes}'' section above for examples.  The specifications are:
%\begin{docspec}
%  \doccmd{begin\{marginfigure\}[\docopt{offset}]}\\
%  \qquad\ldots\\
%  \doccmd{end\{marginfigure\}}\\
%  \mbox{}\\
%  \doccmd{begin\{margintable\}[\docopt{offset}]}\\
%  \qquad\ldots\\
%  \doccmd{end\{margintable\}}\\
%\end{docspec}
%
%Figure~\ref{fig:fullfig} is an example of the \Verb|figure*|
%environment and figure~\ref{fig:textfig} is an example of the normal
%\Verb|figure| environment.
%
%\begin{figure*}[h]
%  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sine.pdf}%
%  \caption{This graph shows $y = \sin x$ from about $x = [-10, 10]$.
%  \emph{Notice that this figure takes up the full page width.}}%
%  \label{fig:fullfig}%
%\end{figure*}
%
%\begin{figure}
%  \includegraphics{hilbertcurves.pdf}
%%  \checkparity This is an \pageparity\ page.%
%  \caption{Hilbert curves of various degrees $n$.
%  \emph{Notice that this figure only takes up the main textblock width.}}
%  \label{fig:textfig}
%  %\zsavepos{pos:textfig}
%  \setfloatalignment{b}
%\end{figure}
%
%Table~\ref{tab:normaltab} shows table created with the \docpkg{booktabs}
%package.  Notice the lack of vertical rules---they serve only to clutter
%the table's data.
%
%\begin{table}[ht]
%  \centering
%  \fontfamily{ppl}\selectfont
%  \begin{tabular}{ll}
%    \toprule
%    Margin & Length \\
%    \midrule
%    Paper width & \unit[8\nicefrac{1}{2}]{inches} \\
%    Paper height & \unit[11]{inches} \\
%    Textblock width & \unit[6\nicefrac{1}{2}]{inches} \\
%    Textblock/sidenote gutter & \unit[\nicefrac{3}{8}]{inches} \\
%    Sidenote width & \unit[2]{inches} \\

%  \caption{Here are the dimensions of the various margins used in the Tufte-handout class.}

%  %\zsavepos{pos:normaltab}
%\end{table}
%
%\section{Full-width text blocks}
%
%In addition to the new float types, there is a \docenv{fullwidth}
%environment that stretches across the main text block and the sidenotes
%area.
%
%\begin{Verbatim}
%\begin{fullwidth}
%Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet...
%\end{fullwidth}
%\end{Verbatim}
%
%\begin{fullwidth}

%\end{fullwidth}
%
%\section{Typography}\label{sec:typography}
%
%\subsection{Typefaces}\label{sec:typefaces}
%If the Palatino, \textsf{Helvetica}, and \texttt{Bera Mono} typefaces are installed, this style
%will use them automatically.  Otherwise, we'll fall back on the Computer Modern
%typefaces.
%
%\subsection{Letterspacing}\label{sec:letterspacing}
%This document class includes two new commands and some improvements on
%existing commands for letterspacing.
%
%When setting strings of \allcaps{ALL CAPS} or \smallcaps{small caps}, the
%letter\-spacing---that is, the spacing between the letters---should be
%increased slightly.\cite{Bringhurst2005}  The \Verb|\allcaps| command has proper letterspacing for
%strings of \allcaps{FULL CAPITAL LETTERS}, and the \Verb|\smallcaps| command
%has letterspacing for \smallcaps{small capital letters}.  These commands
%will also automatically convert the case of the text to upper- or
%lowercase, respectively.
%
%The \Verb|\textsc| command has also been redefined to include
%letterspacing.  The case of the \Verb|\textsc| argument is left as is,
%however.  This allows one to use both uppercase and lowercase letters:
%\textsc{The Initial Letters Of The Words In This Sentence Are Capitalized.}
%
%
%
%\section{Installation}\label{sec:installation}
%To install the Tufte-\LaTeX\ classes, simply drop the
%following files into the same directory as your \texttt{.tex}
%file:
%\begin{quote}
%  \ttfamily
%  tufte-common.def\\
%  tufte-handout.cls\\
%  tufte-book.cls
%\end{quote}
%
%% TODO add instructions for installing it globally
%
%
%
%\section{More Documentation}\label{sec:more-doc}
%For more documentation on the Tufte-\LaTeX{} document classes (including commands not
%mentioned in this handout), please see the sample book.
%
%\section{Support}\label{sec:support}
%
%The website for the Tufte-\LaTeX\ packages is located at
%\url{http://code.google.com/p/tufte-latex/}.  On our website, you'll find
%links to our \smallcaps{svn} repository, mailing lists, bug tracker, and documentation.
